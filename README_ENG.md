# Initial instructions for applying for the 1st project from the course Testing and quality of software products

Dear ERASMUS students,

You have successfully registered your project team for the course Testing and quality of software products. A repository has been automatically created for you that you will use for versioning your code, tests, and also for writing documentation.

This document (ReadmeENG.md) represents the **identity file of your project**. Your first task is to **submit your own project proposal** in accordance with the instructions given in this text. You will write the application of your project in this document instead of this text.

For instructions on the syntax that you can use in this document and when writing your project documentation, please see [this link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
All program code and tests must be versioned in the main **master** branch and **compulsorily** placed in the Software folder. All other artifacts (e.g. images) that you will use in your documentation must be versioned in a special branch that has already been created and is called **master-docs**, and placed in the Documentation folder.

You will receive feedback from the teacher on the team and project proposal, as well as on the final submission. The feedback will be available in Discussions section available on your project's GitHub. 
To submit your project proposal, please use the **template** listed below.. Start by clicking on the *pencil* sign in the upper right corner of this document.
